AnyadsTodos --> later renamed to dlacours-notes
===========

Android app that allows people to keep track of their tasks (Todo list app)

This app allows users to add, remove, archive, unarchive, check, and uncheck tasks. 

Unfortunately, I did not manage to implement saving and loading within the given time-frame, 
therefore exiting the app will cause the user to lose all of their data.


In building this app, I consulted with Lexie Bartlett, Aedan Burnett, and Marcus Karpoff. 
I also watched the StudentPicker videos, and a lot of my initial code came from there.
